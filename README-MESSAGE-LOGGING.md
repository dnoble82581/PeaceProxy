# Message Logging Implementation

This document describes the implementation of asynchronous message logging in the Peace Proxy application.

## Changes Made

The message logging system has been updated to use the asynchronous queue-based logging system instead of synchronous logging. This change improves performance by not blocking the main request thread when a message is sent.

### Files Modified

1. `/app/Services/Message/MessageCreationService.php`
   - Updated the `addLogEntry` method to use `writeAsync` instead of `write`
   - Changed the return type to `void` since `writeAsync` doesn't return anything
   - Removed the `logger($log)` line in `createMessage` since we no longer have a log object to log

## How It Works

When a new message is sent from the NegotiationChat component:

1. The NegotiationChat component calls `MessageCreationService->createMessage` with a MessageDTO
2. The MessageCreationService creates the message in the database
3. The MessageCreationService calls `addLogEntry` to log the message
4. The `addLogEntry` method now uses `LogService->writeAsync` which:
   - Creates a CreateLogDTO with the message data
   - Dispatches a ProcessLogCreationJob to the queue
   - Dispatches a LogCreatedEvent for other listeners
5. The ProcessLogCreationJob is processed asynchronously by a queue worker
6. The log entry is created in the database without blocking the main request thread

## Testing

To test this implementation:

1. Ensure your queue worker is running:
   ```bash
   php artisan queue:work
   ```

2. Send a message in the NegotiationChat component

3. Verify that:
   - The message appears immediately in the chat
   - The log entry is created in the database (check the `logs` table)
   - The queue worker processes the job (check the queue worker output)

4. Monitor performance:
   - The message sending process should be faster since logging is now asynchronous
   - The queue worker should show the log creation job being processed

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Message sending doesn't block the main request thread for logging
2. **Scalability**: Queue workers can be scaled independently
3. **Reliability**: Failed log creation attempts can be retried
4. **Consistency**: Uses the same logging system as other parts of the application
