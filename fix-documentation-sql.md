# Fix for SQL Ambiguous Column Reference

## Issue Description
The application was encountering the following SQL error:

```
SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1052 Column 'id' in where clause is ambiguous (Connection: mysql, SQL: select `users`.*, `conversation_user`.`conversation_id` as `pivot_conversation_id`, `conversation_user`.`user_id` as `pivot_user_id`, `conversation_user`.`joined_at` as `pivot_joined_at`, `conversation_user`.`left_at` as `pivot_left_at`, `conversation_user`.`created_at` as `pivot_created_at`, `conversation_user`.`updated_at` as `pivot_updated_at` from `users` inner join `conversation_user` on `users`.`id` = `conversation_user`.`user_id` where `conversation_user`.`conversation_id` = 3 and `conversation_user`.`left_at` is null and `id` != 2 limit 1)
```

This error occurred when trying to retrieve the other user in a private conversation.

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the code, I identified that the issue was in the `getOtherUserInPrivateConversation` method in the `ChatService` class:

```php
public function getOtherUserInPrivateConversation(Conversation $conversation, int $currentUserId): ?User
{
    if ($conversation->type !== 'private') {
        return null;
    }

    return $conversation->activeUsers()
        ->where('id', '!=', $currentUserId)
        ->first();
}
```

The problem was in the `where('id', '!=', $currentUserId)` clause. When this query was executed, it generated SQL with an ambiguous column reference because:

1. The `activeUsers()` relationship likely performs a join between the `users` and `conversation_user` tables
2. Both tables have an `id` column
3. The query didn't specify which table's `id` column to use in the WHERE clause

This caused the database engine to throw an error because it couldn't determine which `id` column to use for the comparison.

## Solution
The solution was to specify the table name for the `id` column in the WHERE clause:

```php
return $conversation->activeUsers()
    ->where('users.id', '!=', $currentUserId)
    ->first();
```

By changing `id` to `users.id`, we explicitly tell the database to use the `id` column from the `users` table for the comparison, resolving the ambiguity.

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Resolves Ambiguity**: By specifying the table name, we eliminate the ambiguity in the SQL query.
2. **Minimal Code Change**: Only a small change was needed to fix the issue.
3. **Maintains Functionality**: The method still performs the same function, but now without the SQL error.

This fix ensures that users can now view private conversations without encountering the SQL error.
