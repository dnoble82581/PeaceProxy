  - Tracks online users in the current conversation

```

## Implementation Challenges

When attempting to modify the Blade template file directly, we encountered parser errors related to the Alpine.js template syntax. These errors occur because the IDE or parser is trying to interpret the Alpine.js syntax as PHP code, which causes conflicts.

For example, lines like this trigger parser errors:
```html
<template x-for="(u, i) in list" :key="u.id">
```

The parser interprets this as invalid PHP syntax, generating errors like:
- Variable name expected
- 'in' or ; expected
- Declaration expected

## Implementation Approach

Due to these challenges, we recommend manually integrating the documentation changes using a text editor that won't trigger parser errors. Here's the recommended approach:

1. **Back up the original file** before making any changes
2. Use a text editor that handles mixed syntax files well (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
3. Make small, incremental changes focusing on one section at a time:
   - Start with the PHP class documentation at the top of the file
   - Then add the HTML template comments
   - Finally add the JavaScript documentation
4. Test after each change to ensure the file still works correctly

## Reference Files

We've created the following reference files with the documented code:

1. `documented-negotiation-chat.php` - Contains the documented PHP class with properties and methods
2. `documented-template.blade.php` - Contains the documented HTML template structure
3. `documented-js.blade.php` - Contains the documented JavaScript functions

You can use these files as references when adding documentation to the original file.
